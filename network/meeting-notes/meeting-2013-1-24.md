2013-1-24 Meeting notes:
========================

Agenda
--------

- timeline for design until due date
- Discuss data types that will be handled by client and server
- Discuss the kinds of functions we would need for the interface
    - for e.g., sendplayerdata(), sendplayerposition(),
    getplayerposition(), etc.
- Anything else to discuss?
- next meeting date

Notes
-------

Data types for server side:

* Positions
* Environment stats, player stats
* game stats

Data types for client side:
    
* physics

Data passed through TCP:
    
* math stuff: unit health, gold/resources etc

Data passed through UDP:

* player position
* user input

Classes:
    
* Movable units, non-movable units
* Movable:
    * Player controlled
    * creeps
* Non-movable:
    * towers
    * trees, mountains, etc.

Function calls:
    
* update unit stats
* update movable unit position

How to move this info?

- Group stats together
    - player info (health points, experience)
- incrementally update small data over UDP
- Have intervals that will update data in a large scale over TCP

Very basic thing we need to do:

- have update functions as game progresses
- CRUD and synchronization functions
    - ready synchronization pre-game
        - global data, team-specific, match, and player

Design 0.1
-----------

- Get to matchmaking stage
    - Client connect to server
    - Server needs to acknowledge
        - informs of other players
        - what map to use.
    - delimit with types, filling in struct of game data
    - all sent over tcp
    - player select team and position (clients)
    - start match by propagating data across clients and synchronizing

- header_t struct
    - uint type = MAPNAME
    - size_t size;

- map_t
    - header_t head;
    - char value [32];

- player_matchmaking_t
    - name : char[64]
    - team : int
    - role : int
    - ready : bool

---

    mapstruct mymsg;
    mymsg.head.type = MAPNAME;
    mymsg.value = "bcit";
    mymsg.head.size = sizeof (strlen());
    
    send(client, &mymsg, sizeof(msg));
    
    // client side
    header_t head;
    recv_complete (&head, sizeof(header_t))
    
    if head.type == MAPNAME
        map_t map;
        recv_complrete (&map, header.size)
    
    
    Player Behnam connect >> (to server)
    
    (to clients) << Server to Behnam MSG_UPDATE_PLAYER_INFO player_matchmaking_t 1 << MSGPLAYER 2 << MSGPLAYER N // Server synchronizes new player with current players. (Get up to date)
    
    Player Behnam MSG_UPDATE_PLAYER_INFO >> player_matchmaking_t >> (to server)// Player sends what it wants to
    
    (to clients) << Server Everyone << Behnam << MSG_UPDATE_INFO << player_matchmaking_t // Server responds with authoritative response and updates everyone else

        if (not False in [player.ready for player in players])
            << Server MSG_START <<
